Python provides a method for strings to split them and create a list.

Suppose you have a string str with comma separated colors "orange,red,blue"

now,
str.split( "," ) creates a list containing all colors seperately.
[ "orange" , "red" , "blue" ]

So, the split method breaks a single string into muliple strings for easy manipulation.

Suppose the user input a filename,
fn = "file.py"

to find the extension,

* we need to split the filename with a dot(.) which will create a list containing two words ["file","py"] where the last word is the extension of that file that can be accessed with list[-1] which returns the element at -1 (last element).
