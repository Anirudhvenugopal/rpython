PYTHON LIST :
A list is a container which holds comma separated values (items or elements) between square brackets where items or elements need not all have the same type.
In general, we can define a list as an object that contains multiple data items (elements).
You can also think of list as arrays in different programming languages.
The contents of a list can be changed during program execution. The size of a list can also change during execution, as elements are added or removed from it.

PYTHON TUPLE:
A tuple is container which holds a series of comma separated values (items or elements) between parentheses such as an (x, y) co-ordinate. 
Tuples are like lists, except they are immutable (i.e. you cannot change its content once created) and can hold mix data types. 


STEPS:

*Inout comma separated values using input() function

*use split() function to split those values and create a list.

*Use tuple() function to convert list into tuple

*Print list & tuple with print() function.
