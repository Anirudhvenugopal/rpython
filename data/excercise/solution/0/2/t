In geometry, the area enclosed by a circle of radius r is πr2.

Here the Greek letter π represents a constant, approximately equal to 3.14159, which is equal to the ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter.
 
Python provides math module that has a constant variable pi


STEPS:

*Import pi from math module using from & import statement

*Taking radius as input from the user using input() function.

*Convert the given radius to floating number using float() function

*Calculating area using the formula ( pi * r**2 ) where r**2 means r square.

*Displaying the area with print function
