In this example we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2 positive numbers.

GCD of 2 numbers is the greatest number with which both the numbers are divisible.

Suppose you have 2 numbers,

n1 = 4
n2 = 6

now 6 is divisible by 1,2,3 and 4 isdivisible by 1,2
So the common divisor's between 4 & 6 are 1,2.
and between the common divisor(1,2) the greatest one is called GCD i.e. 2

Hope you get this
