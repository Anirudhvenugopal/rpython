The print statement (of Python 2.6) has been replaced with a print() function (of Python 2.6)

The print() function doesn’t support the “softspace" feature of the old print statement.

Here's the difference

PYTHON 2.X
print "Hello World"

PYTHON 3.0
print("Hello World")

Initially you'll be finding yourself typing the old print x a lot in interactive mode. Time to retrain your fingers to type print(X) instead!

steps are simple:

* use print() function to display text.
