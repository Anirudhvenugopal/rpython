In this example we only need to check whether the number is even or odd and to do we need to find the remainder after dividing the number by 2.
Hope you already know what actually is even & odd number.

So, to find the remainder we use % operator available in python and if the remainder after dividing by 2 comes to 0, then it is EVEN else it is ODD
