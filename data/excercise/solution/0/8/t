Suppose the user inputs a number,
n=5

now, we need to calculate the value 5+55+555 using math algorithm.
it's very simple,

to turn n into nn, just multiply it with 10 and add n
n1 = n*10+n i.e. 5*10+5 which returns 55 and using the same algo you can turn 55 into 555, i.e.
n2 = n1*10+n i.e. 55*10+5 which returns 555.

now to compute the final value of 5+55+555 we will add n+n1+n2.

sum = n+n1+n2 = 615
